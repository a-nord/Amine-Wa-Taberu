This is an interactive front-end group project.  This is an opportunity to show employers our collaborative skills and coding abilities.

## Application Description
This application provides an interactive anime theme search.  A user can search for anime theme songs and they will be provided with a a set of search results.  When the user chooses an anime, a new page comes up with the artist of that theme song of the anime.  There will be a header of the anime behind an image of the artist of the song.  The user will be able to see information about the artist as well as a few more songs from the artist if they are interested.  There will be a search option on this page just incase the user would want to search for another anime theme song.
